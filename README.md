## Project History

All of us enjoy TV, but it can be hard to figure out where you are in each show you're watching, given how distributed content is across platforms.
When all of us ended up in the Agile Development class, we were drawn to Sam's proposal for a method of dealing with cross-platform content organization.
As such, we decided to make TV Tracker. We realized that there is a need for an easy system of organization and classification for TV and movies; that's where we come in.
That's how TV Tracker was born.
