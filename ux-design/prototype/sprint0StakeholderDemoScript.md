# TV Tracker

## Sprint 0 Stakeholder Demo Script

To be used alongside [this prototype](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/NQ10DOCUPSY2).

### Home Screen

Sam: Welcome to TV Tracker! TV Tracker is an easy interface for keeping track of the shows and mocies you watch across many platforms.
I don't know about you, but I watch TV shows on a ton of different streaming services--Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Disney+, and more.
It can be hard to remember where you're watching each show you're watching, especially if a show is on multiple platforms. That's where TV Tracker comes in.

Ben: From the home screen, users can click the hamburger menu and access the "my shows" screen without logging in, or can log in or sign up by clicking pretty much anywhere on the home screen.

### Click Hamburger, My Shows

Lev: On the My Shows screen, prospective users and already registered users can view the shows they are currently watching or have finished watching, and can search for new shows.
In addition, users can filter their lists by the platform their media is on, allowing the user to view just media on Netflix or Prime.
Clicking on a show or searching for a show will bring up the Individual Show page (click on Henry Kissinger: The Movie).

Mason: This shows basic information about the show, and allows the user to mark their progress through it and select the platform it's on.
Users who are not logged in can search for media and test out the app a bit before they add a show to a list tied to their account.

### Click Hamburger, Profile
Nicole: From the User Profile page, the user can see their most recently added show, which links to the individual show page; click My Shows to visit that page;
click settings (click settings) to edit the user's email, password, bio, and profile pic; (click back);
and click the "share" button to copy a shareable link to the user's profile to the user's clipboard.

### Click TOS at the bottom of the screen
Ben: The footer of every page links to the basic terms of service (click meet the team) and a meet the team page that displays basic contact info for team hatsukaichi-dynamic.
